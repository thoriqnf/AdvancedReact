  "readme": "# [React Apollo](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/) [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-apollo.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-apollo) [![Get on Slack](https://img.shields.io/badge/slack-join-orange.svg)](http://www.apollostack.com/#slack)\n\nReact Apollo allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the React framework. React Apollo may be used in any context that React may be used. In the browser, in React Native, or in Node.js when you want to do server-side rendering.\n\nReact Apollo unlike many other tools in the React ecosystem requires _no_ complex build setup to get up and running. As long as you have a GraphQL server you can get started building out your application with React immediately. React Apollo works out of the box with both [`create-react-app`][] and [React Native][] with a single install and with no extra hassle configuring Babel or other JavaScript tools.\n\n[`create-react-app`]: https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app\n[react native]: http://facebook.github.io/react-native\n\nReact Apollo is:\n\n1.  **Incrementally adoptable**, so that you can drop it into an existing JavaScript app and start using GraphQL for just part of your UI.\n2.  **Universally compatible**, so that Apollo works with any build setup, any GraphQL server, and any GraphQL schema.\n3.  **Simple to get started with**, you can start loading data right away and learn about advanced features later.\n4.  **Inspectable and understandable**, so that you can have great developer tools to understand exactly what is happening in your app.\n5.  **Built for interactive apps**, so your users can make changes and see them reflected in the UI immediately.\n6.  **Small and flexible**, so you don't get stuff you don't need. The core is under 25kb compressed.\n7.  **Community driven**, Apollo is driven by the community and serves a variety of use cases. Everything is planned and developed in the open.\n\nGet started today on the app you’ve been dreaming of, and let React Apollo take you to the moon!\n\n## Installation\n\nIt is simple to install React Apollo and related libraries\n\n```bash\n# installing the preset package (apollo-boost) and react integration\nnpm install apollo-boost react-apollo graphql-tag graphql --save\n\n# installing each piece independently\nnpm install apollo-client apollo-cache-inmemory apollo-link-http react-apollo graphql-tag graphql --save\n```\n\n[apollo-boost](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master/packages/apollo-boost) is a minimal config way to start using Apollo Client. It includes some sensible defaults, such as `InMemoryCache` and `HttpLink`.\n\nThat’s it! You may now use React Apollo in any of your React environments.\n\nFor an amazing developer experience you may also install the [Apollo Client Developer tools for Chrome][] which will give you inspectability into your React Apollo data.\n\n[apollo client developer tools for chrome]: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm\n\n## Usage\n\n> Looking for apollo 1.x docs? See [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/apollo-docs-1.x/index.html).\n\nTo get started you will first want to create an instance of [`ApolloClient`][] and then you will want to provide that client to your React component tree using the [`<ApolloProvider/>`][] component. Finally, we will show you a basic example of connecting your GraphQL data to your React components with the [`<Query>`][] component.\n\nFirst we want an instance of [`ApolloClient`][]. We can import the class from `apollo-client`.\nTo get started, create an ApolloClient instance and point it at your GraphQL server:\n\n```js\nimport { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-client';\nimport { HttpLink } from 'apollo-link-http';\nimport { InMemoryCache } from 'apollo-cache-inmemory';\n\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\n  // By default, this client will send queries to the\n  //  `/graphql` endpoint on the same host\n  // Pass the configuration option { uri: YOUR_GRAPHQL_API_URL } to the `HttpLink` to connect\n  // to a different host\n  link: new HttpLink(),\n  cache: new InMemoryCache(),\n});\n```\n\nIf you're using [apollo-boost](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/tree/master/packages/apollo-boost), you can create an `ApolloClient` that uses `HttpLink` and `InMemoryCache` like so:\n\n```js\nimport { ApolloClient } from 'apollo-boost';\n\nconst client = new ApolloClient();\n```\n\n> Migrating from 1.x? See the [2.0 migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/recipes/2.0-migration.html).\n\nNext you will want to add a [`<ApolloProvider/>`][] component to the root of your React component tree. This component [provides](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) the React Apollo functionality to all the other components in the application without passing it explicitly. To use an [`<ApolloProvider/>`][] with your newly constructed client see the following:\n\n```js\nimport { ApolloProvider } from 'react-apollo';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <ApolloProvider client={client}>\n    <MyRootComponent />\n  </ApolloProvider>,\n  document.getElementById('root'),\n);\n```\n\nNow you may create components in this React tree that are connected to your GraphQL API.\n\nFinally, to demonstrate the power of React Apollo in building interactive UIs let us connect one of your components to your GraphQL server using the [`<Query>`][] component:\n\nYou'll need install `graphql-tag` to use `gql` module:\n\n```bash\nnpm install graphql-tag --save\n```\n\n```js\nimport gql from 'graphql-tag';\nimport { Query } from 'react-apollo';\n\nconst GET_DOGS = gql`\n  {\n    dogs {\n      id\n      breed\n    }\n  }\n`;\n\nconst Dogs = ({ onDogSelected }) => (\n  <Query query={GET_DOGS}>\n    {({ loading, error, data }) => {\n      if (loading) return 'Loading...';\n      if (error) return `Error! ${error.message}`;\n\n      return (\n        <select name=\"dog\" onChange={onDogSelected}>\n          {data.dogs.map(dog => (\n            <option key={dog.id} value={dog.breed}>\n              {dog.breed}\n            </option>\n          ))}\n        </select>\n      );\n    }}\n  </Query>\n);\n```\n\nIf you render Dogs within your App component, you’ll first see a loading state and then a form with a list of dog breeds once Apollo Client receives the data from the server.\n\nTo learn more about querying with React Apollo be sure to start reading the [documentation article on Queries][].
